You can use this phone book
[here](https://erastfandorin.github.io/goit-react-hw-02-phonebook/) Manage your
save contacts(`localstorage`).

In this project I mastered:

- React
- react-create-app
- redux, redux-toolkit, react-redux
- react-transition-group
- reselect

All components are in the src folder. `.editorconfig`, `.eslintrc`, `.huskyrc`,
`.lintstagedrc`, `.prettierrc` - configuration files for plugins used for to
format the code and keep it clean All another files was generated by
react-create-app

You can run this project locally just do:

clone branch `review` with
`git clone https://github.com/erastfandorin/goit-react-hw-02-phonebook.git` or
fork it and then clone it from your forked repo `cd goit-react-hw-02-phonebook`
`npm install` `npm start`
